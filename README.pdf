This repository is the final project of our embedded systems class (ECE 5780) for Spring 2024.
It was completed by a team of three people:
  - Eddison Yang
  - Freddie Rice
  - Shem Snow

See the "report.pdf" for an overview of the project.
Code can be found in Core > Src

The .c files included are:
  - Valves: Uses the USART protocol to handle keyboard inputs selecting specific valves in the system and opening or closing them.
  - main: Top level file for the initial setup, running the main loop, and handling interrupts.
  - motor: uses Pulse Width Modulation to drive an output voltage which we used to power a pump. Different levels of output controlled the pump's speed. 
  - temp: controls communication with the temperature sensor using the 'one wire' protocol.
